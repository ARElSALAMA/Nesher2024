# Nesher2024
  The goal of this Nesher project was to create various different GUI applications in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

  To do this I would be implementing the built-in module Tkinter to create a window in which I could put in various dofferent GUI elements (such as buttons, textboxes, etc.). 

  After having created 3 distinct application - with an extra app linking them all together - I had heard of a module which woul have given me much more customization over teh different GUI elements. This was the [CustomTkinter module](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). I then updated all of the apps to implement this tool.
